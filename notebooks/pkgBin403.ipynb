    "# How to develop a package\n",

    "## GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "You'd better to have a github account for \n",
    "\n",
    "- ease to share your package.\n",
    "- codes safty. Cloud storage is not easy to lose.\n",
    "- collaboration with your colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have an account there already , you can just sign in. Or you can sign up GitHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you logged on GitHub, click new in your homepage. In the next page,\n",
    "1. choose a reposity name, e.g., `Bin403.jl`\n",
    "2. add some description\n",
    "3. select `public`, or `private`. If you want to share your package globally, choose `public`.\n",
    "4. add a `README` file. This will be the first page of your newly created package. It is markdown.\n",
    "5. add `.gitignore`. Choose a `.gitignore` of Julia.\n",
    "6. add a license. I usually use a MIT license."
